## Usage Notes

### Connection issues

A Southerner soon as a Northerner, a planter nonchalant and hospitable down by the Oconee I live. We have thus far exhausted trillions of winters and summers. What do you think has become of the young and old men? The grave of rock multiplies what has been confided to it, or to any graves. The crew of the fish-smack pack repeated layers of halibut in the hold. Who has done his day's work? who will soonest be through with his supper? Vapors lighting and shading my face it shall be you!

### Sound Reactivity

Carrying the crescent child that carries its own full mother in its belly. How he knuckled tight and gave not back an inch, and was faithful of days and faithful of nights. I lead no man to a dinner-table, library, exchange. My words itch at your ears till you understand them. Not words of routine this song of mine.
